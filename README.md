# Simple Blog (Dart+PHP)
This study was carried out with the aim of:
- acquire skills in programming on Dart (client side) and,
- write api applications in PHP (server side).
The work was carried out with the knowledge base that is currently available, therefore some solutions are far from ideal. But I don't believe that you can read a book and then immediately do everything right. Need practice.
